If a developer would like to use this repository, you will need to create the .env files in your folder to access the neccessary environment variables. To do this, create two new files, one called '.env.development' and the other '.env.test'. Inside the delopment file, write 'PGDATABASE=database_name_here', with database_name_here being the correct name of the database. Inside the test file, write 'PGDATABASE=database_name_here_test', with database_name_here being the correct name of the database with \_test at the end.
